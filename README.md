# Presentation about coupling and independent microservices

This presentation is about the negative effects of coupling and how most coupling is
introduced by the `if` statement. It talks about software architecture starting with
the simplest example all programmers know: and if statement.

I received a lot of possitibe feedback about this approach. Because the presentation
starts with this simple if statement it is easier to follow by junior and medior 
software developers and it builds it's way up to real challanges software architects
face when designing an system.
